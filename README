What is need to run the script:

-tkinter and Pillow libraries
-file with list of buildings named "output.txt", where records are stored in rows, where rows are separated by tabs in this way:

Name of building	City	height	date of appearance	date of disappearance (optional)

for example:

World Trade Center	New York City	417	1971	2001 

-files which have the same names as the the building declared in the list, for example "World Trade Center.png", their scale doesn't matter
-files with country flags (you must )
-a folder named "years" where subsequent frames of animation are created (if you are working on linux you must change \\ to / in line 176)

Also, gif is created by ImageMagick
